<h2>Things I do for love</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
  A cat strolling through a world trying to find the one he loved
</li>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
  A relaxed atmosphere while exploring the fun times of Valentines, honestly an "relaxing" vibe while enjoying classic style side platformers
</li>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
  Platformer type of game 
</li>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
  The player can collect hearts and use basic movement. After a series of hearts are collected a new part of the world is "unlocked" and the game map itself is expanded. The only issue is that there are various enemies in which the player must dodge to not get hurt and lose his drive to find his love.
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
  The game mechanices are World building or drawing, and camera movements
</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
  The audio, and the in-game world expansion based on a culminated amount of objectives
</li>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
  A japanese themed city , the cat roams around the world trying to find the cat he once loved. In his way stands rascal rabbits and a possible loss of passion, will his fortitude withstand?
</li>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
  The story again is a cat that lost the one he loved and roams throughout the city areas in hopes that he will find that one cat. 
</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
  Side scrollers and people who prefer ambient games
</li>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
  Possibly up to 5-10 minutes
</li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
  Being dodgy, in other words making use of platforms and dodging opponents as they come
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
  Most came from the generic phaser resources but the artwork comes straight from deviant art, and the music was by Calvin harris and the sprite for the main character came from SpriteDatabase but is actually from a game called "burger cat"
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
  Starstruck is perhaps the closest one to this game.
